# Flow Field with Moving Balls trajectory

This project demonstrates a flow field visualization with multiple balls moving according to the vector field. Each ball leaves a trail (path) colored based on its speed and position. 

## How it Works

- **Flow Field Generation**: Uses Perlin noise to generate a flow field where each cell indicates a direction.
- **Balls Movement**: Multiple balls move according to the flow field, updating their positions and leaving paths.
- **Path Visualization**: Paths are drawn behind each ball, with color intensity indicating speed and distance traveled.

## Setup

- Ensure you have Processing installed ([Download Processing](https://processing.org/download/)).
- Copy the code into your Processing editor.
- Run the sketch to see the flow field and moving trajectories.
